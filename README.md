# Web Scrapping Genius

There are two scripts that scrap different data from Genius website page called "top songs" (https://genius.com/#top-songs).

To run scripts, run this commands in that order:
1. `python3 parsing_info.py`

2. `python3 parsing_imgs.py`

After first one, you'll get csv file with info about top songs. After second one, you'll get folder with song covers.

In the folder "song_images" you can check several examples of song covers. If you want more, you can run the scripts but it takes some time!:)
